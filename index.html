            British shorthair cats are one of the oldest recognized cat breeds,
            first thought to have been brought to Britain by the Romans. Prized
            for their soft, plush coats and rounded bodies, British shorthairs
            could almost be mistaken for living teddy bears. This beautiful breed comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns, but the traditional British shorthair is wrapped in blue fur.

            <h2>History</h2>
            An ancient breed, British shorthairs are believed to be the direct descendants of the cats brought to England by the invading Romans, according to The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. They were used for vermin control and quickly spread throughout the country as street and farm cats. Soon, their calm and confident personalities prompted people to welcome them into their homes (and onto their laps). Over the years, according to The Cat Fanciers' Association, they developed round faces with short, thick coats of all colors.
